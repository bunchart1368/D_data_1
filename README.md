# Throughout the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to undertake a data scientist internship at dData company. This experience provided me with a comprehensive understanding of various aspects within the data scientist field, including XGBoost modeling, PowerBI utilization, data cleansing techniques, and data interpretation methodologies.

The final project of my internship involved the following key components:

**Customer Engagement Analysis**: I conducted an in-depth analysis of customer engagement using transactional data gathered from across the United States. Utilizing PowerBI for visualization purposes, I assessed engagement levels across different states, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.
**Customer Location Analysis**: Leveraging tools such as Google Earth Engine and Python programming, I conducted an extensive analysis of customer locations. By extracting statistical data from the Image Collection within Google Earth Engine's database, I was able to generate insightful business intelligence for each state. This involved the implementation of Python scripting techniques to derive meaningful conclusions and recommendations.
