# Customer Engagement & Location Analysis – dData Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the final project from my **Data Scientist Internship at dData Company, Thailand**, during the summer of 2023 (second-year internship).  

The project focuses on **data analytics and visualization** for answering business questions related to **customer engagement from transactional datasets**.  
Key deliverables include:  
- Customer engagement analysis across U.S. states  
- Visualization dashboards built with **Power BI**  
- Customer location analysis using **Google Earth Engine** with **Python**

## 🔎 Background
During this internship, I gained hands-on experience with **XGBoost modeling, Power BI dashboards, data cleansing, and business interpretation**.  
The final project reflects a combination of **data engineering, visualization, and geospatial analytics**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze **customer engagement patterns** from transactional data.  
- Provide **business insights** into customer behavior and preferences.  
- Use **geospatial data** to analyze customer locations and demographics.  
- Build a **Power BI visualization dashboard** for decision-making.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Customer Engagement Analysis
- Conducted an in-depth analysis of engagement levels using transactional data across U.S. states.  
- Built interactive **Power BI dashboards** to highlight customer behavior and regional differences.  
- Derived actionable insights on engagement trends and customer preferences.  

### Customer Location Analysis
- Used **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** combined with **Python scripting** to analyze customer distribution.  
- Extracted statistical data from GEE’s **Image Collection** database.  
- Provided geospatial insights and **state-level business intelligence reports**.

## 💻 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost (for modeling)  
- **Visualization**: Power BI  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Google Earth Engine (Python API)  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
